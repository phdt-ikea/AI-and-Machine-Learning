    "# Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "You have been hired by a telecommunications company to develop a machine-learning model that predicts customer churn. The company wants to identify customers who are likely to cancel their service so they can take proactive steps to retain them. The model you develop will be integrated into the company’s customer relationship management (CRM) system and used by the marketing team to target at-risk customers with retention offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project requirements\n",
    "1. Predictive accuracy: The model must accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: The model should be able to handle a large volume of data, as the company has millions of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integration: The model needs to be easily integrated into the company’s existing CRM system, which is built on a Python-based backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Efficiency: The model should be optimized for real-time or near-real-time predictions to allow timely interventions by the marketing team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load provided dataset\n",
    "Load the customer churn dataset\n",
    "Using the provided link to the dataset, download the file and import it into your notebook. Make sure it is named correctly and is the correct file type. This dataset file is designed to be small and straightforward, making it simple to use for understanding these processes. We will explore this topic in greater depth later in the “Advanced AI and Machine Learning Techniques and Capstone” course.\n",
